# Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) - MVP

## Project Overview

This is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) submission for the CCRM project. Due to time constraints, this version focuses on demonstrating the core Object-Oriented Programming principles of Abstraction, Inheritance, and Encapsulation as required.

It includes the foundational domain classes (`Person`, `Student`, `Course`) and a simple main class to demonstrate their creation and functionality.
